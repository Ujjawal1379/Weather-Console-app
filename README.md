 Java Weather App (Console-Based)

This is a simple Java console application that fetches and displays real-time weather information for any city entered by the user. It uses the free WeatherAPI service to retrieve data and the org.json library to parse JSON responses. The application is built with Java 11+ and uses the modern HttpClient API for making HTTP requests.

Features
- Fetch current weather by city name.
- Displays city, region, country, temperature in Celsius, and a weather condition description.
- Uses Javaâ€™s latest HttpClient for API calls.
- Simple and lightweight console interface.

Technologies Used
- Java 11 or later
- WeatherAPI (Free tier API key)
- org.json library (for JSON parsing)
